# Rayman 3 Readvanced
![Title screen](assets/logo/rayman_3_readvanced.png)

This project is a recreation of the Game Boy Advance and N-Gage versions of Rayman 3 to [MonoGame](https://monogame.net), with the goal of porting the game to PC and other platforms. The original ROM is required to play the game since this project does not contain the game assets.

This is not meant to be a traditional decompilation, but rather a recreation of the game in C#. However, the game code is written to be functionally identical to the original code and much of the same structure of the original engine is kept, as seen by decompiling the game using Ghidra.

*The goal is to have the game be functionally identical to the original GBA game, while modernizing the code and including optional game enhancements.*

You can view the current progress of this port in [the progress document](PROGRESS.md) as well as the currently planned features in [the todo document](TODO.md).

## GbaEngine
The original game uses [Ubisoft's GbaEngine](https://raymanpc.com/wiki/en/GbaEngine), an engine which was written in C and built from Ubisoft's Game Boy Color engine. The engine is object-oriented, which makes it work well for a C# re-creation, and consists of several, mostly independent, modules.

See the [documentation](gbaengine/documentation.md) for more information on the engine, what code changes this port has made and other technical details. You can also check the [discoveries](gbaengine/discoveries.md) to see things such as unused contents, bugs and other oddities found in the game's code.

## Enhancements
This version contains several optional enhancements over the original game. The most notable is that the game can be played in high resolution and widescreen. This provides a much better experience on modern devices as you're no longer limited to the small screen of the GBA.

Besides graphical enhancements there are various quality of life improvements and optional gameplay tweaks which can be toggled. There is also an assortment of bonus features, such as built-in achievements and more.

*The game can render in higher resolution and different aspect ratios.*

### Button mapping
The button mapping will be made customizable in the future, along with controller support. As of now this is the current mapping:

| **Description**          | **Input**          |
|--------------------------|--------------------|
| GBA A-button             | Space              |
| GBA B-button             | S                  |
| GBA Select-button        | C                  |
| GBA Start-button         | V                  |
| GBA D-pad                | Arrow keys         |
| GBA R-button             | W                  |
| GBA L-button             | Q                  |
| Toggle pause             | Ctrl+P             |
| Speed up game            | Left shift         |
| Run one frame            | Ctrl+F             |
| Toggle debug mode        | Tab                |
| Toggle menu              | Escape             |
| Toggle showing collision | T                  |
| Toggle no-clip           | Z                  |
| Increase no-clip speed   | Space              |
| Scroll camera            | Right mouse button |
| Toggle fullscreen        | Alt+Enter          |

You can also launch the game with a BizHawk .bk2 TAS file which will have it play the button inputs from that.

## Supported platforms
The following platforms are currently supported. More platforms are planned in the future.

- Windows 7 and above (x64)

## Supported game ROMs
The following ROMs are supported. Prototype ROMs will not work due to them using different addresses and earlier game data.

- Rayman 3 (GBA - Europe)
- Rayman 3 (GBA - USA)
- Rayman 10th Anniversary (GBA - Europe)
- Rayman 10th Anniversary (GBA - USA)
- Winnie the Pooh's Rumbly Tumbly Adventure & Rayman 3 (GBA - Europe)

## Debug mode
Pressing the `tab` key while playing will toggle the debug mode. This is set up using ImGUI and is meant to help debugging the game.
