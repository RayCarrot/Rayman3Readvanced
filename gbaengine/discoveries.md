# Discoveries

### General
- The `MechModel` function array, which defines the movement of an actor, has the function accidentally `Mode7_SetAccelerationY_SetTargetSpeedY_ResetSpeedX` defined twice, leaving the `Mode7_SetAccelerationY_SetTargetSpeedY` function, which was meant to be used at the second place, unused. This would mess up with the actor movements if it was used, but no actors in Rayman 3 use this movement type.
- There are various message IDs which are unused. They are as follows:
    - 1000-1001
    - 1032
    - 1051-1052
    - 1071
    - 1092
    - 1094
    - 1096-1099
    - 1101
    - 1104-1109
- The `Scene2D` constructor for some reason disables the background scrolling for the first map of `Cave of Bad Dreams`. This was added late during development judging by the prototypes.
- The Mode7 camera has 3 unused states for a free-cam like mode. These were used in the early prototypes.

### Actors
Most actors have the first animation be unused and just single frame, most likely for their level editor. This is not included when mentioning unused animations for each actor.

#### BoulderMode7
- The boulder sprite rotates either left or right depending on its direction. It however doesn't take the camera into account, meaning that the rotating will only look correct from one direction. This is very noticeable as several of the boulders will look as if they're rotating in the opposite direction from where they're moving.

#### LumsMode7
- Due to this being the only Mode7 actor to use affine rendering while also having an animation it causes it to mis-align when scaled. This is noticeable the further away the lum is with it then appearing to jump between two points during the animation.
- The blue lums, which give you a boost, are only found in the multiplayer mode. However there is unused code to handle them in single player too. This was used in the early prototypes.

#### MissileMode7
- When checking for if you've let go of the accelerate button it calls `IsButtonJustReleased`, which should never be used during gameplay. That's because if you pause while the button is held down and then let go while paused it will never register by the actor. This causes it to keep thinking you're holding the button down.
- During multiplayer you can spectate other players after dying. You switch between players by pressing A, which causes the screen to fade out before moving the camera. The timing is however wrong, as the fade out lasts 32 frames while the camera moves after 16 frames. This makes the transition between players very jarring.

#### RaymanMode7
- There's an unused function which kills you if you're touching insta-kill collision.
- There is some leftover code from how the Murfy tutorial box used to be triggered.
- There's an animation bug that occurs during the same frame that you hit the water after jumping (first frame of it switching from the jumping animation) where Rayman's sprites will be all messed up. This is due to how the game updates the animations here which causes it to not correctly account for if the animation is in "delay mode", thus making it not load the correct graphics for the new animation.

#### BluePirate
- The actor can optionally be configured to drop a red lum after being defeated, but this is never used.

#### Caterpillar
- There is unused code to handle the caterpillar dying if hit by another caterpillar.

#### Electricity
- The following animations are unused:

![Animation 8](discoveries_assets/Electricity_Anim_8.gif)

- One of the hitboxes for the big variant when facing left is misaligned. This is due to the code not correctly flipping the hitbox, making it appear more to the right than it should.
