# TODO
This document contains a list of planned features for Rayman 3 Readvanced, in no particular order. Besides this there are also various TODO comments in the code which should be resolved and the main progress is documented over at [Progress](PROGRESS.MD). I'll gladly accept any help anyone would be willing to provide for this project!

## üìÉ General
- Show icon with animation in the screen corner when saving.
- If you change the button mapping then the in-game tutorial texts are wrong, such as when Murfy or Ly explain how to perform a move. Find a way to replace this.
- The camera doesn't work as well on N-Gage when playing in widescreen due to it being optimized for a portrait aspect ratio. Fix by having a setting for the camera where it's either in GBA, N-Gage or Adaptive mode.
- Add option in the menu to convert save files between GBA and N-Gage as well as importing/exporting between Readvanced and emulators. The save data is the same, so should be easy.
- Move hard-coded values to constants. There are a lot of these in the game!
- Add a cheat menu?
- When rendering in a resolution that's not a factor of the internal resolution then the sprites in animations don't always align correctly and there may be a 1 pixel gap. Fix by always rendering to the highest possible factor of the internal resolution and then scaling to the actual resolution?
- Add more Murfy help messages throughout the game since they mostly appear in the beginning and don't explain later mechanics. For example, explain that in the race levels you can press L and R to strafe to the sides.
- Translate new text to the available languages.
- Make sure the gameplay is the same for things like multiplayer, time trials etc. so that actor cycles and such stay the consistent. Also disable debug features then to prevent cheating.

## üéÆ Multiplayer
Implementing local multiplayer, using multiple game instances (through named pipes) or through LAN, shouldn't be too hard. The game's multiplayer code is very simple, with it usually just sending a single 16-bit value between clients each frame.

It might also be possible to implement split-screen multiplayer where each player has its own Scene2D instance and viewport. The HUD should be re-done though and static things like sounds need to be correctly handled.

However online multiplayer would be much more complicated. The game expects the communication between clients every frame, which would require very low latency (probably around 16 ms?). If we can get it working then this library would be a potential option: https://github.com/RevenantX/LiteNetLib

## ‚öôÔ∏è Options
### üìÉ General
- Have option presets, such as "Modern" and "Original". Also clarify for each option which value is the original one. In the code we give each option a tag to indicate which preset it's included in.
- Option to disable camera shaking as it can cause nausea for some players.

### ‚åö Performance
- Option not to clear cache between Frame instances.
- Option to pre-load all textures in animations and tiles when initializing a new Frame instance.
- Option not to cache serialized data from the ROM. Currently it always does that.
- Option to pre-load all levels asynchronously during intro sequence.
- Use single texture sheets for AnimatedObject and maybe tiles too as to avoid creating too many textures.

### ‚ú® Optional improvements
The following are ideas for optional improvements which the player can toggle on to enhance/modernize the game experience. To avoid too many options we should probably bundle some of these together into common options such as "Rebalance game".

- Play unused level start animation.
- Infinite lives. Have silver lums fully restore health instead and add achievement for collecting them all so they still have a purpose.
- Fix the helico animation hitbox for Rayman.
- Slightly increase hitbox width for moving platforms.
- Move faster in worldmap (when holding down button?).
- Press the select button while in a hub world to bring up level info bars for every level for that hub in a vertical, scrollable, list, with you selecting one to teleport to that level curtain.
- Kyote time, allow jumping after a few frames (game already has a system for it, but only used for specific cases such as moving platforms that burn up).
- Have enemies, such as the helico bombs in the waterski levels, not instakill you.
- Have tiles, such as the spikes in the cave of bad dreams, not insta-kill you. Allow you to stand on them when on i-frames?
- Restore original Rayman 2 level names.
- Option to check for buffered inputs? Pass in buffer length in the JoyPad check methods? For jumps, attack etc. as to avoid it feeling like inputs get lost.
- Option to not clear collected lums if you die in a race level.
- Option to use GBA sounds for the N-Gage version.
- Option to not show N-Gage button prompts in the corners.
- Option to use Rayman 2's health system where you don't instantly die when falling into pit, and max HP increases from cages.
- Option for less insta-kill, such as with the flying shell.
- Option for visual enhancements, such as not disabling the Mode7 fog effect when you die.
- Option to remove stray pixels and fix bad tiling in some levels.
- Extend backgrounds so that they can render in the modern widescreen resolution without scaling:
    - BossMachine ‚úîÔ∏è
    - BossRockAndLava
    - BossFinal_M1
    - BossFinal_M2
    - Power2
    - Power5
    - Power6
    - Worldmap
    - Check multiplayer, menus etc. and check N-Gage
- GBA effects can be used in the N-Gage version, but sometimes the N-Gage version improves things too. Allow these to be used in the GBA version.

## ‚≠ê Bonus
### Achievements
Rewarded for things such as:
- Game progress (finish world, beating boss, unlocking new power etc.).
- Completion (all lums/cages in word, 100% game etc.).
- Gameplay (defeat enemies, performing common actions like jumping etc.).
- Specifics (complete a level in a special way, such as not defeating any enemies or not using purple lums, riding a keg backwards, defeating an enemy with a keg/sphere etc.).

### Time trials
List of time trials which you can play from different pre-selected levels. Probably not the entire levels since that doesn't sound fun. Have it be more like Rayman Origins where it's only part of a level.
- While in a level you have ways of freezing the timer. This can be special time freeze items we add, or it's from collecting lums and cages. This adds risk vs reward as you might want to go out of your way to find these. Perhaps collecting them all gives you a time bonus at the end, like how Crash Team Racing does?
- Finishing a time trial gives you either bronze, silver or gold. Show these next to each time trial in the list. You want to get all gold!
- Finishing a time trial saves your ghost (we can do that by saving Rayman's state, pos, anim etc., each frame). Upon replaying you can show the ghost. Perhaps the bronze, silver and gold requirements each also have ghosts which are pre-recorded?

### Challenges
List of challenges you can play. These put you into a level and has you attempting to beat the challenge. Some ideas:
- Beat level without taking any hits (have this for harder levels, such as Prickly Passage, or bosses).
- Beat level with Dark Rayman chasing you (this would work well for levels where you have to change direction a lot, such as first section of Vertigo Wastes).
- Beat level with darkness effect from Rayman 1.
- Beat level in reverse (start at the end and make your way back to the beginning).
- Beat Rock and Lava Boss without using blue lum (using damage boosts).
- Beat level while playing as Murfy (new gameplay style where you fly).
- Collect all yellow lums in race during one lap.
- Beat Marshes of Awakening 1 without moving to the side (so only jumping).
- Find hidden collectible in level.

### Mods
Allow you to install mods to the game by creating a folder for each mod which can they contain replaced textures, text, sounds etc. as well as new languages for fan-translations.

### Level editor
A level editor could be created where you can create your own levels using tilesets from the existing levels, or add your own tilesets. You could even just use a static texture for the level map, but collision has to always be tile-based.

The actors could be selected from a list, where each actor has a list of valid initial states it can be in.

## üêû Bugs
- Is keg collision wrong when flying? See Mega Havoc 2. It seems more strict than the original game.
- An exception gets thrown if closing the game while it's loading the rom.
- The music and sfx volumes aren't balanced for N-Gage.
- In levels where the cycles of objects matters, like the flying keg ones, it doesn't line up well if all objects are always loaded, making some parts impossible to beat
